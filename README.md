<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project had implemented an application basing the consistency-driven pairwise comparisons method. This application could be used as a supplement of any expert or knowledge management system.

* Multi-criteria decision making which is a sub-discipline of operations research explicitly evaluates multiple conflicting criteria in decision making. The consistency-driven pairwise comparisons method is a valuable tool for solving multi-criteria decision making problems. It is a powerful inference tool that could be used for knowledge acquisition for the knowledge management system. In fact, pairwise comparisons are basics for practically the entire science and have been used for projects of national importance.

* It features Virus / File Scanning Feature, it detects and delete the file from the server.

I was one of the graduate student of [Prof. W.W Koczkodaj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldemar_W._Koczkodaj) and this research project was done as part of my thesis under his guidance.
